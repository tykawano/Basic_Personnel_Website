                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Greetings! My name is Taiki Kawano and welcome to my website!<br>
                        Please join me as I continue to pursue my Computer Science degree<br>
                        at Dalhousie University. This website will highlight my continued<br>
                        interest in technology and coding within the surrounding CS field,<br>
                        but will also highlight my general hobbies and interests as an individual.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Why did I chose CS?</h2>
                    <p>My fascination for technology first began through an interest in building different<br>
                        computational machines. In my spare time I tinkered with various computers and built<br>
                        things such as keyboards, computer mice, and calculators. I started playing with things<br>
                        like raspberry piâ€™s and different programs such as scratch and photoshop which furthered<br>
                        my interests for computers. I realized that much of what I was trying to do needed a vast<br>
                        knowledge into coding and general understanding of how circuits operated. My journey is<br>
                        only beginning and I plan to showcase my various projects and education through this website.
                    </p>
